# GPS Data Prediction Using Kalman Filter

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of a Kalman Filter to process and predict GPS data. It includes a simulation of GPS coordinates with latitude and longitude values and applies a Kalman Filter to smooth and predict future positions. The project is implemented in Python and designed to run in a Google Colab environment for ease of use and accessibility.

The Kalman Filter is a powerful mathematical tool for tracking and predicting states in dynamic systems, especially when the data includes noise. This project simulates noisy GPS data and uses the Kalman Filter to reduce the noise and predict smoother paths.

## Features
- Simulation of noisy GPS data (latitude and longitude).
- Implementation of a Kalman Filter for noise reduction.
- Visualization of original and filtered GPS data.
- Fully functional in Google Colab with minimal setup.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Google Colab
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - pykalman

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gps-kalman-filter.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Google Colab.
3. Install the required libraries (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   !pip install pandas numpy matplotlib pykalman
   ```
4. Run the notebook to simulate GPS data and apply the Kalman Filter.
